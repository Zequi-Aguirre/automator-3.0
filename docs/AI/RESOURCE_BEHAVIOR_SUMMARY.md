# AskZack Resource Behavior Summary (v1)

This document captures the behavior of the REST API layer (resources/controllers) of the AskZack backend.  
Each resource defines a public HTTP interface for managing entities through the corresponding service layer.

All routes (except `/api/authenticate`, `/api/mock-vendor`, `/api/leads-open`) are globally protected by  
the **`Authenticator.authenticateFunc()`** middleware defined in `AutomatorServer.ts`.  
Therefore, all endpoints below are **authenticated by default**.

---

## 🧩 affiliateResource.ts

### **Purpose**
The `AffiliateResource` exposes REST endpoints for affiliate management.  
It provides administrative functionality for reading, updating, and inspecting affiliate data.

---

### **Routes Overview**
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description | Underlying Service Method |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| `GET` | `/admin/get-many` | Returns paginated list of affiliates. Accepts `page` and `limit` query params. | `affiliateService.getMany()` |
| `PATCH` | `/admin/update-meta/:affiliateId` | Updates affiliate metadata (rating, blacklist). | `affiliateService.updateAffiliateMeta()` |
| `GET` | `/admin/:affiliateId` | Retrieves details for a specific affiliate. | `affiliateService.getById()` |

---

### **Authentication & Security**
✅ All routes are authenticated through `Authenticator.authenticateFunc()` middleware.  
❗ Requires a valid API key or token — handled automatically by the AutomatorServer setup.

---

### **Architectural Behavior**
- Routes are organized under `/admin/*`.  
- Fully asynchronous (async/await) and dependency-injected via tsyringe.  
- Relies on `affiliateService` for all data access and mutation.  
- Responds with structured JSON payloads.  
- Handles missing affiliate with `404 Not Found`.  

---

### **Improvement Opportunities**
- Add input validation for `PATCH` request body using a schema (`zod` or `yup`).  
- Wrap all service calls in `try/catch` for consistent error handling.  
- Add request/response logging for traceability.  
- Define response DTOs for consistent API shape.  

---

### **Cross-Layer Interactions**
```
AffiliateResource
 ├─ AffiliateService (business logic)
